### ▶ 就算Python也知道爱是个复杂的东西 *

```py
import this
```

Wait, what's **this**? `this` is love :heart:
（译注：我认为这句话原汁原味的看才能体会其中的乐趣，就不翻译了😊）

**Output:**
```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

这些（指上面输出的内容）就是Python之道！

```py
>>> love = this
>>> this is love
True
>>> love is True
False
>>> love is False
False
>>> love is not True or False
True
>>> love is not True or False; love is love  # 爱(love)是个复杂的东西，不是吗？
True
```

#### 💡 解释:

* `this`模块是一个针对Python之道做阐述的彩蛋([PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020))。
* 但是这并没有完，如果你看看这个模块的实现代码[this.py](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/c3896275c0f6/Lib/this.py)。你会发现一个更加有趣的事情，那就是这个代码本身就违反了上面输出的Python之道（当然，我觉得这也是唯一一处违反的地方）。
* 关于`love is not True or False; love is love`这句话，它解释的很对，不是吗？
